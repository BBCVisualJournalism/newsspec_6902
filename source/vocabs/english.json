Cafu               <br>An almost impossible choice at right-back between Cafu, the only player to play in three World Cup finals, and Carlos Alberto, the scorer of one of the most iconic World Cup final goals. It's interesting that older Brazilians regard Djalma Santos from the 1950s & 1960s as better than both of them.",
    "pundit_002_team_description": "3. Bobby Moore<br>England's only World Cup-winning captain just has to be in there. You don't have to be old enough to have seen him play live to know that few players in football's history have read the game and timed tackles as well.<br><br>4. Franz Beckenbauer                                       <br>One of those rare players who you think might have excelled in any era. The template for modern ball-playing defenders.<br><br>5. Roberto Carlos<br>Difficult, but his explosive energy just puts him ahead of two of my all-time favourites who were better defensively - Maldini and Brehme.<br><br>6. Xavi<br>I've surely got to include a member of Spain's wonderful World Cup-winning team from 2010, so who better than the man who was at the heart of the mesmerising midfield carousel.<br><br>7. Andrea Pirlo<br>The passmaster in Italy's 2006 triumph and a player I could watch all day – as many opponents have had to! Was a close call between the Italian and Gerson - the &quot;brain&quot; of Brazil's 1970 team.<br><br>8. Zinedine Zidane<br>My favourite footballer of all time. His performances in 1998 left a huge mark on me, and the mark he left on Marco Materazzi eight years later was the most sensational sign-off ever to any sporting career.<br><br>9. Pele<br>You can't select an all-time World Cup XI and not include the man still considered to be the best that ever played.<br><br>10. Diego Maradona<br>I think more people would say he was the greatest ever, instead of Pele, were it not for the controversies that came with his incredible abilities.  <br><br>11. Gerd Muller<br>In looking for a pure finisher I wanted to include Lineker or Klinsmann, but I have to go with Muller for his remarkable record of 14 goals from 13 World Cup games, including the winner in the 1974 final.",

He was massive and commanded his area but he was agile too.<br><br>2. Carlos Alberto <br>There were attacking full-backs before Carlos Alberto but, at the 1970 World Cup, he played in the best team I have ever seen. He was so comfortable on the ball, he could have played anywhere.",
    "pundit_003_team_description": "3. Franz Beckenbauer <br>He was so good, he was able to dictate the way West Germany played from the back. Their team was all about him and he was coolness personified. I don't think I ever saw him give the ball away.<br><br>4. Bobby Moore <br>People said he had no pace but, like Beckenbauer, he was never caught out of position. He was also a sweet passer of the ball, which people often overlooked. Cool and calm, he was a leader.<br><br>5. Paolo Maldini <br>He could play anywhere - centre-back or midfield too if you wanted. A great tackler, he was strong and able to dominate opponents. I don't recall anybody ever getting the better of him.<br><br>6. Michel Platini <br>Like all the best players in the world, the bigger the game, the better his performance. As well being a playmaker he was also a goalscorer from pretty much every position, and deadly with free-kicks too.<br><br>7. Zinedine Zidane <br>He was the best player I ever saw in a tight space because he was able to get away from anybody. As well as being a creator and scoring spectacular goals, he could get them with his head too.<br><br>8. Jairzinho <br>At the 1970 World Cup he gave England's Terry Cooper, who was a top left-back, all sorts of problems. He was strong, direct and a great crosser. His link-up play with Pele in 1970 was on a different planet.<br><br>9. Johan Cruyff <br>He used to ghost into positions and glide past players. Fantastic vision and a top-class goalscorer, he was a brilliant footballer and the main man in the fabulous Dutch team of the 1970s.<br><br>10. Diego Maradona <br>Runs Pele very close for the title of greatest player ever. He was at least 50% of the reason Argentina won the 1986 World Cup and he single-handedly got them to the final in 1990.<br><br>11. Pele <br>What a player he was – big, strong, a fantastic touch and a great leap. Amazing in the air and it was like he had radar because he knew absolutely everything that was happening around him.",

He seemed almost to redraw the possibilities in goalkeeping. <br><br>2. Philipp Lahm  <br>His adaptability almost gets him a game on its own. Left-back, right-back, centre midfield, he is effortlessly world class anywhere. There are very few errors and no noticeable weaknesses.",
    "pundit_004_team_description": "3. Paolo Maldini   <br>His longevity gives him the nod over the rest, but he is comfortable all along the back four. He has no discernible weaknesses either defensively or offensively.<br><br>4. Claudio Gentile  <br>You need someone really hard, who can also play, when surrounded by such classy footballers in the back four, just in case someone needs sorting out.<br><br>5. Franz Beckenbauer   <br>A player who developed a new template for a position. He oozed class and controlled entire games from deep. It is a contractual obligation that you use the word &quot;classy&quot; when describing his play.    <br> <br>6. Cristiano Ronaldo   <br>At his best, as he is right now, he comes as close to unstoppable as you get. Skill, power, pace and height all as perfectly balanced and in place as his hair.    <br><br>7. Andres Iniesta  <br>Someone has to represent what Spain has done for world football. It could be Xavi, David Silva or a number of others, but Iniesta was always my favourite. His vision is as good as anyone's I have seen.<br><br>8. Zinedine Zidane<br>Zizou was a strange player. He had all the delicate skills you could wish for with an almost balletic style, yet he was tall and as strong as they come. <br><br>9. Johan Cruyff   <br>A player who reimagined the template of a position. Effortless grace and vision and he was the core of a totally new look to the game.<br><br>10. Pele  <br>He must be in any side because he was the best player in the world for such a long time. It took Diego Maradona's arrival for anyone to consider that someone else could even be in the same bracket.<br><br>11. Diego Maradona    <br>Head and shoulders above anyone else in his generation. For a long time I thought he would never be surpassed as the most skilful player in football history. A genius.",

    "pundit_005_team_description_intro": "1. Dino Zoff <br>The heart said England's Gordon Banks, a World Cup winner in 1966 and the man who made arguably the greatest save in the tournament's history from Pele in Guadalajara four years later. In the end though, a 40-year-old veteran who captained an Italy side that came out of the pack to win in Spain in 1982 gets the vote. Zoff was a legendary figure for his club Juventus and his country – and his feats in the World Cup made him an iconic sportsman.<br><br>2. Carlos Alberto <br>Carlos Alberto was a player of such ability and a character of such force that he captained Brazil's 1970 World Cup-winning team containing Pele, still the benchmark for any great side. Any memory of their World Cup final win against Italy in Mexico's Azteca Stadium in 1970 is not complete without the image of Carlos Alberto racing on to Pele's delicate lay-off to rifle in the final goal in their 4-1 win.",
    "pundit_005_team_description": "3. Paolo Maldini <br>Played in four World Cups and was one of the greatest defenders ever to have graced the game. A wonderful ambassador as well as player, Maldini was the perfect combination of the great Italian defender with a mixture of silk and steel. <br><br>4. Bobby Moore <br>The only Englishman to lift the World Cup as captain, the glory coming at Wembley in 1966. This will ensure the West Ham captain's place in history - not only as the leader of Sir Alf Ramsey's victorious side but as a magnificent defender of authority, a calming presence and a consummate reader of the game. Moore may not have been able to repeat the feat in Mexico four years later but made his mark with a wonderful display in defeat against Brazil, perfectly illustrated by his famous tackle on Jairzinho and his embrace with Pele at the final whistle.<br><br>5. Franz Beckenbauer <br>One of football's towering figures and a player of brilliant versatility, Beckenbauer was the midfielder deputed to keep Bobby Charlton quiet in the 1966 final and, four years later, played on with a broken collarbone in the semi-final loss to Italy. He is the only man to captain and coach World Cup-winning teams. No all-time great XI is complete without &quot;Der Kaiser&quot;.<br><br>6. Zinedine Zidane <br>Grace and power were his watchwords and his two goals in the France 98 final against Brazil in Paris made him a national hero. Zidane's World Cup story is scarred by his red card for head-butting Italy's Marco Materazzi in the 2006 final but his greatness and his impact when France won merits his inclusion.<br><br>7. Michel Platini <br>Those of a certain age can cast their minds back from his current role as Uefa president to the era when he was the grand creator in a wonderful, free-flowing France team in the late 1970s and 80s. A scorer and maker of goals and one of the great players.<br><br>8. Bobby Charlton <br>Charlton's goals helped England win the World Cup in 1966 and he was still such an influence in Mexico four years later that his premature substitution is still regarded as the turning point in the quarter-final loss to West Germany. Charlton mixed power and elegance and had a magnificent range of passing, plus a powerful shot that made him a regular scorer of spectacular goals in a career that flourished out of the adversity of the Munich air disaster in 1958.<br><br>9. Pele <br>A World Cup winner as a teenager in 1958, then again in 1962 and 1970. The great Brazilian vies with Argentina's Diego Maradona for the title of football's greatest player. Quite simply brilliance personified and one of the first two names on this teamsheet.<br><br>10. Diego Maradona <br>Maradona may be a notorious figure in England for his &quot;hand of God&quot; goal in the quarter-final in Mexico in 1986 but few players have exerted their influence on a World Cup as he did when he led Argentina to victory that year. The controversies came later when he tested positive for a banned substance in 1994 but when you write this team out, his name appears alongside Pele.<br><br>11. Johan Cruyff <br>Think of this elegant, lavishly gifted individual and you think of the &quot;Cruyff turn&quot; paraded at the 1974 World Cup and of the man who was the symbol for the Netherlands' brand of &quot;total football&quot;. A losing finalist in 1974 but a personality and player who stamped his mark all over that World Cup.",
